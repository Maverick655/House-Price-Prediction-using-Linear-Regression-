# House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project repository! This project aims to predict house prices using linear regression on a dataset containing features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on its features. By training a linear regression model on historical data, we aim to create a predictive model that can provide valuable insights into the housing market.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:
- Size of the house (in square feet)
- Number of bedrooms
- Number of bathrooms
- Location (e.g., city, neighborhood)
- Year built
- Lot size
- Garage size
- etc.

The target variable is the price of the house.

## Source
The dataset can be downloaded from below link.

## Techniques Used
- Linear Regression: Utilizing the linear regression algorithm to establish a relationship between the independent variables (features) and the dependent variable (house price).
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing the performance of the linear regression model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Download the house price dataset and preprocess it as necessary.
4. Train the linear regression model on the preprocessed dataset.
5. Evaluate the performance of the trained model and make predictions on new data.

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the house price dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
2. **Model Training**: Train a linear regression model using the preprocessed dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared (R2) score.
4. **Prediction**: Make predictions on new data using the trained linear regression model.
